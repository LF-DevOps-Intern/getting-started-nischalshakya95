## ssh keys generation with ssh-keygen

ssh keys were created in the root user's ~/.ssh directory for all three users. 

```
ssh-keygen -C"this is ssh key for hary" -f is_key_hary
ssh-keygen -C"this is ssh key for encrypted" -f is_key_encrypted
ssh-keygen -C"this is ssh key for tom" -f is_key_tom
```
